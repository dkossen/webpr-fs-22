    // Assignment: Using 'Function()'

    /* Your user has entered a new business rule on how to calculate this year's bonuses.
    He entered a formula through a web form and it is available through the _string_ variable 'bonusFormula'.
    The formula refers to the employee as 'employee' like in 'employee.revenue * 0.2'
    (note that this only calculates but does not set the bonus)

    Provide a function (or lambda expression) named 'bonusCalculation' that calculates an employee's bonus
    by using the user-provided bonusFormula.

    Since we will give bonuses to many employees, do _NOT_ use the 'eval' function
    and do _NOT_ use side effects like setting surrounding variables. */


    // Test

    const e = {revenue: 10000, bonus: null};
    bonusCalculation(e);
    e.bonus === e.revenue * factor_;
