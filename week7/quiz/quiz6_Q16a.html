    // Assignment: Function composition


    /* JavaScript is functional and functional languages should provide function composition.
   Let's assume we have functions like
    const inc    = x => x + 1;
    const double = x => x * 2;
   Provide a general function 'then' that can combine _any_ such functions such that
    inc.then(double).then(double)
   can be used like
    inc.then(double).then(double) (1) === 8

   Note: you cannot assume what the functions are actually doing.
   It must work for all functions! */

 // Test:
 add.then(mult).then(add) (1) === (1 + add_) * factor_ + add_
